# Portfolio website frontend

The front-end for my personal website is being developed in [Angular](https://angular.io) an frontend JavaScript
framework maintained by Google. This forntend is intended to serve the
[ASP.Net backend API](https://github.com/GerniVisser/Portfolio-Website-Backend)
to create a visually stimulating and reactive GUI for users to inteact with the backend API.

## Usage/Examples

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. Configure the angualar.json folder to set the folder location of the build. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Run with backend

Clone and run the backend repo to get access to the backend API on `port:localhost/44300`
