        <div class="generalText" style="padding-top: 4%; padding-bottom: 8%">
            <p>
                I am super curious and fascinated by the ability presented by computers to create something out of nothing but an initial idea. 
                Take this webpage, I started this project with a blank editor knowing this project will have something to do with HTML and Webhosting. 
                By diving headfirst into the intricate inner workings of web development 
                I managed to create a multi-threaded microservice architecture hosted on the scalable cloud platform to host a multitude of web apps in the future.  
            </p>
            <p>
                This method of exploration learning made me independent of any single tool or language, as I explore and learn how to use new tools as I need them. 
                In this journey of mine, I have completed projects in languages like 
                Python, Java, JavaScript, Go and C# and using technologies like ASP.NET, Unity 3D, OpenCV, and many more without any prior knowledge of any of these tools.

        <div class="mb-2 generalText"  style="padding-top: 4%;">
            <p>
                I have worked on many projects over the years in many different sub-categoryâ€™s 
                within computer science, including Web-dev, Game-dev, Artificial Intelligence and 
                Neural Networks, Microcontrollers, and mobile development. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My greatest passion is designing backend systems to be as efficient and secure 
                as possible. I love engineering new algorithms to solve a specific problem as 
                efficiently as possible without compromising functionality.
