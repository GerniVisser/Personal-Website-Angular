            <p>
                Im a super curious guy facinated by the ability to craete something from nothing. 
                Take this webpage, I started with a blank editor knowing this project 
                will have something to do with HTML. Using this same stratagy driven by an idea and my inhabition 
                I was able to create some pretty cool projects. In this journey of mine I have become fluent in Python and
                C# and using thecnologies like ASP.NET, Unity, OpenCV and many more.
